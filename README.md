## MHXX Online Web Sim Translate Script

**THIS USERSCRIPT IS OUTDATED AS THE WEB APP NOW HAS ENGLISH**

This is a userscript to translate the online MHXX armor sim tool (http://mhxx.wiki-db.com/sim/?hl=en#) into English.

This tool takes the Japanese text and translates it into its English in-game equivalent. This userscript applies to both:

* http://mhxx.wiki-db.com/sim/?hl=en#/*
* http://mhxx.wiki-db.com/sim/show/*

A video demonstration can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/yAeBtcq.mp4

### Disclaimers

This script is not perfect. Please note the following:

* Decoration names are not translated
* Skill names are translated, but skill points are not translated
* Some armor pieces may not be fully translated from JP to English. If you spot these, please submit an issue to this Github Repo so I can add/edit the script
* I am not responsible if the script misleads you into building a set that isn't correct.
